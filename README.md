# Application

Simple template to test openshift build with environment variables


1. Dockerfile of a simple rack application
  - the rack application reads from a file /tmp/greeting.txt created on build time
  - /tmp/greeting.txt content is generated by `GREETING` environment variable which default to `hello`

2. template.yml is an Openshift template:
  - it sets `GREETING=Aloha!` on build time so it overrides the Docker env
  - So when run in Openshift the rack application should display `{"greeting": "Aloha!"}` instead of `{"greeting": "hello"}`
